          <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>Instructions:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a
              9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and
              line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered
              sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and
              vanilla.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just
              combined.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok)
              and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or
              until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note:
              it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in
              too long). Cool completely before slicing. Store in an airtight
              container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze
              well!
            </li>
